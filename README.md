This project uses a machine learning model called logistic regression to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using a dataset named data.csv. First, it removes unnecessary columns like 'id' and 'Unnamed: 32', and changes the 'diagnosis' column to numbers: 1 for malignant and 0 for benign. Then, it separates the data into two parts: features (X) that describe the tumor, and the result (y) that shows if it's cancerous. The data is split into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).

To make the data clean and easy for the model to use, it fills in any missing values with the average and scales all features to be on a similar range. After that, it trains the logistic regression model on the training data.

The model gives us coefficients, which show which features are most important in making predictions. We then check how well the model works using tools like a confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve. The code also finds the best threshold to make the model's predictions more accurate.

To help understand how logistic regression works, it shows the sigmoid curve, which is used to turn feature values into probabilities. Lastly, it shows the top 5 features that help the model guess if a tumor is cancerous or not, and prints the final equation the model uses to make predictions.
